# ArtExplorer
Overview

ArtExplorer is designed for art enthusiasts that would like to catalog their favorite artists. Whether a user is interested in learning more about contemporary or classical artists, considering collecting art or wants to view images of artwork from a particular artist, ArtExplorer provides a method to find and save that information. After searching for an artist by name, the user has the option to save a card with artist's name, an image of one of the artist's artworks and a link with more information on the artist's background. Furthermore, the User login information is secured to the database using hash authentication.
